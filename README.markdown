Sneaky Bastard
==============

#### A surveillance tool for OS X systems

Sneaky Bastard is a tool for tracking usage of your Mac OS X machine.
It does this by taking user photos via the built-in iSight* camera on
user triggered events like logging in, system wakeup or deactivation of
the screensaver. Sneaky Bastard can also send the stored photos to a
preconfigured email address.

*any webcam should also work but this hasn't been tested.

### System Requirements ###

Mac OS X 10.5 and later
iSight camera

### Building from source ###

If you got the latest commit off any of the git branches, Sneaky Bastard should 
build without issues on Xcode 3.2 (It'll probably build off Xcode 3.4 since its
not dependent on any IB plugin).
